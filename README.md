# DSP-Based-BPSK-Transmitter-and-Receiver-with-ADALM-PLUTO-SDR
MATLAB/Python-based DSP project implementing a BPSK transmitter and receiver with ADALM-PLUTO SDR. Includes signal generation, pulse shaping, FIR/IIR filtering, constellation analysis, SDR configuration, and quantized filter design. Demonstrates full Tx/Rx chain with simulation and SDR integration.
